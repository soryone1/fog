Programming Fog
===========
This is an Arduino library designed to be used with my own board - Programming Fog. With this board, you can easily control all liquid mist related projects, such as DIY humidifiers, DIY aromatherapy machines, and any other projects or installations you can imagine.

I implements two features which normal boards in those devices don't provide:

* Be able to start the fog and stop the fog.
* Be able to control the fog amount based on a simple 5v analogRead value.
